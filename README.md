Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  In project 2, I learned how to implement and experiment with a reinforcement algorithm. This algorithm incorporated is an asynchronous advantage actor-critic that essentially have layers of networks that communicate with each other and produce the best action faster. The algorithm was not trained using human data, rather it trained itself by playing the game over and over, generating a gradient of possible actions. 

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are some of the most capable proble solvers. A company can approach a computer scientist with a problem they are having and he can provide some solutions to this issue. For example, a company has an issue managing user profiles and needs a new system. The computer scientist would come in and analyze the system, and either build a new one and upgrade the current one. They are essential, especially in today's world, because of the growing dependancy on technology. If you want to have a business, it needs to be online and will need scientists to help with the incorporation and building of online systems. They are just as important because of how fast technology evolves as well. You will need to have your software up to date to keep up with security and other features. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
First, you analyze the current situation. You need to breakdown the processes and functionality of a problem into managable parts. Then, you plan. You have to plan the design or implementation of a new or updated system. After designing and double checking things are good to go, is the building phase. During building, constant checks and testing should occur to ensure functionality and progress. After building is maintaining, where you need to train people to manage the new system and how to manage it.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
To do diligent, quality work. As software engineers/ scientists, we have a duty to the employer/clients of the company we are working for to provide quality, secure code. We are usually dealing with personal information of our users and we have to protect it by ensuring we have the proper security and functionality in our applications we build.
